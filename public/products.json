According to studies on drug interactions, theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1mg/ethinyl estradiol 35mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin did not exhibit any clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics at the recommended clinical dose of it. In clinical investigations, the medication was used concurrently with a variety of routinely prescribed medications without showing any signs of clinically harmful interactions, despite the fact that more detailed interaction studies were not carried out. Thyroid hormones, hypnotic sedatives, benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and decongestants were among these drugs. Following a single dose of this solution, the hepatic metabolism-inducing drug phenobarbital reduced the drug's AUC by about 40%. For this medication, no dosage modification is advised. When powerful cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are provided alongside this solution, it is fair to use proper clinical monitoring."
